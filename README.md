<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This provides all simulation and analysis code to produce the results of [Constructing future behaviour in the hippocampal formation through composition and replay](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.07.536053v1.abstract).


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You need to install [python >= 3.6.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pytorch >= 1.6.0](https://pytorch.org/).


### Installation

Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jbakermans/state-space-composition.git
```

### Reproducing Figures

Each figure panel is generated by a simulation script that is executed by navigating to its directory, then running
```sh
python simX.py
```

The simulation scripts correspond to the preprint figure panels as follows:

- Fig 2c,e: ContinuousPlanning/sim4.py
- Fig 2d,f: ContinuousPlanning/sim5.py
- Fig 3b: DiscretePlanning/sim1.py
- Fig 3c: ContinuousPlanning/sim1.py
- Fig 4c: DiscretePlanning/sim2.py
- Fig 4c inset: ContinuousPlanning/sim2.py
- Fig 5b: DiscretePlanning/sim2.py
- Fig 5e,f discrete: DiscreteHoming/sim1.py
- Fig 5e,f continuous: ContinuousPlanning/sim3.py
- Fig 6a,b: DiscretePlanning/sim3.py
- Fig 6c: DiscretePlanning/sim4.py
- Fig 7: HierarchicalPlanning/sim1.py
